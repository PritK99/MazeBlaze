# MazeBlaze-v2.1

In this project, we will be working on Improvising PCB design and Sensor Placements of MazeBlaze bot and Implement a better maze solving algorithm on the MazeBlaze bot in order to attain maximum speed while traversing.

Our Main aim is to design an algorithm , which will enable us to map the entire maze and hence give us the shortest path. Further , we plan to improvize the design by trying new components and trying new sensore placements etc . 

The end goal of our project is to form a Maze-solving and a line-following bot , which can find the shortest path in the maze.
