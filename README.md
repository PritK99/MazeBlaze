# MazeBlaze-v2.1

## About

In this project, we will be working on Improvising MazeBlaze bot and Implement a maze solving algorithm on the MazeBlaze bot. The Main aim is to design an algorithm , which will enable us to map the entire maze and hence give us the shortest path. Further , we have improvised the design by understanding the current electronics and t 

The end goal of our project is to form a line-following, Maze-solving bot , which can find the shortest path in the given maze.

## Domains Explored
Embedeed C, Graph algorithms, electronics, Basics of PCB design etc.
